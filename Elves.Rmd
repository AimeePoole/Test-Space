## How many elves should it take to make all the presents for the uk.

- Assumptions 
  - They work from 1 January to the 24 of December 
  - 9 to 5 
  - 5 days a week
  - Each child under 16 gets 3 presents.
  - You make assumptions for everything else based on research
    - E.g. how long each present takes on average 



## Example Solution

- Research and estimate hours needed per present (on average)
    - e.g. 2 hrs (elves are magic fight me) 

- Research average working days in a year
    - 260

- calculate - Elf present output
    -  Elf present output = days they can work * 8 hours / hours needed per present (on average)
    -  Elf present output = (260 * 8) / 2
    -  Elf present output = 1040



## Example Solution pt 2

- Research/Calculate quantity of population under 16
    - Poputaion of uk is 69,729,988 (https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/)
    - 19.5 % under 16 (https://lginform.local.gov.uk/reports/lgastandard?mod-metric=3288&mod-area=E92000001&mod-group=AllRegions_England&mod-type=namedComparisonGroup)
    - ∴ quantity of children under 16 = 69,729,988 * 0.195
    - quantity of children under 16 = 13597347.7
    - 13597348


## Example Solution pt 3

- Calculate - presents needed
    - presents needed = children under 16 * 3 presents 
    - presents needed = 13597348 * 3
    - presents needed = 40792044

- Calculate - elves required 
    - elves required = presents needed / elf present output 
    - elves required = 40792044 / 1040
    - elves required = 39223.1192
    - elves required = 39224

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
